golang (1:58-1) unstable; urgency=low

  Most significant upstream changes in this release:
  * As usual, gofix will handle the bulk of the rewrites necessary for
    these changes to package APIs.
  * Package http drops the finalURL return value from the Client.Get
    method. The value is now available via the new Request field on
    http.Response. Most instances of the type map[string][]string in have
    been replaced with the new Values type.
  * Package exec has been redesigned with a more convenient and succinct
    API.
  * Package strconv's Quote function now escapes only those Unicode code
    points not classified as printable by unicode.IsPrint. Previously
    Quote would escape all non-ASCII characters. This also affects the fmt
    package's "%q" formatting directive. The previous quoting behavior is
    still available via strconv's new QuoteToASCII function.
  * Package os/signal's Signal and UnixSignal types have been moved to
    the os package. 
  * Package image/draw is the new name for exp/draw. The GUI-related code
    from exp/draw is now located in the exp/gui package.
  * Goinstall now observes the GOPATH environment variable to build and
    install your own code and external libraries outside of the Go tree
    (and avoid writing Makefiles).
