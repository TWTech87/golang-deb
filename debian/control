Provides: go-compiler
Description: Go programming language compiler
 This package provides compiler and linker for the Go programming
 language.  This is the Google's Go implementation of the tool chain.
 .
 The Go programming language is an open source project to make
 programmers more productive. Go is expressive, concise, clean, and
 efficient.  Its concurrency mechanisms make it easy to write programs
 that get the most out of multicore and networked machines, while its
 novel type system enables flexible and modular program construction.
 Go compiles quickly to machine code yet has the convenience of
 garbage collection and the power of run-time reflection.  It's a
 fast, statically typed, compiled language that feels like a
 dynamically typed, interpreted language.

Package: golang-doc
Architecture: all
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: Documentation for Google's Go programming language
 This package provides the documentation for the Go programming
 language.
