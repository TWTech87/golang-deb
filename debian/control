Description: Google's Go programming language compiler
 This is the compiler for Google's Go programming language:
  - The compilers produce fast code fast. Typical builds take
    a fraction of a second yet the resulting programs run
    nearly as quickly as comparable C or C++ code.
  - Go is type safe and memory safe. Go has pointers but no
    pointer arithmetic. For random access, use slices, which
    know their limits.
  - Go promotes writing systems and servers as sets of
    lightweight communicating processes, called goroutines,
    with strong support from the language. Run thousands of
    goroutines if you wantâ€”and say good-bye to stack overflows.
  - Go has fast builds, clean syntax, garbage collection,
    methods for any type, and run-time reflection. It feels
    like a dynamic language but has the speed and safety of
    a static language. It's a joy to use.
